			<p class="article">Analysts have theorized that losing 25 lbs may have reduced his cuddly appearance and therefore hurt his broad fan appeal. Others have countered the issue stems from the fact that the team sponsored by <a href="http://pandoonation.com">Pandoo Nation</a> is the only team currently registered in the Elite Open division.</p>
